# Dataset Documentation

This repository uses publicly available datasets to train and evaluate two **Deep Learning models** in the restaurant review domain:

- **Sentiment Analysis (SA)**
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

The datasets are organized in a structured manner to ensure reproducibility and compatibility with the training pipelines provided in this project.

## Data Sources & Credits

All datasets used in this project are sourced from public repositories. Full credit is given to the original authors and contributors.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- **Dataset Name:** MIT Restaurant Corpus
- **Description:** Annotated restaurant-related queries with entity labels (e.g., food, price, location)
- **Source:** Kaggle – MIT Restaurant Corpus CRF Dataset

## Sentiment Analysis (SA) Dataset

The Sentiment Analysis dataset contains customer-written restaurant reviews labeled with sentiment polarity.

**Location:** `dataset/sa/`

**Formats Available:**

- CSV (`Restaurant_Reviews.csv`)
- TSV (`Restaurant_Reviews.tsv`)

**Schema:**

| Column Name | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Review      | Text content of the restaurant review        |
| Liked       | Sentiment label (0 = Negative, 1 = Positive) |

This dataset is used to train a binary text classification model based on transformer architectures.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER) Dataset

The NER dataset is designed to identify and classify restaurant-related entities within text, such as food items, pricing information, locations, and services.

**Location:** `dataset/ner/`

**Format:** Plain text files (`.txt`)

**Data Organization:**

- Sentence files (`sent_*.txt`) contain one sentence per line
- Label files (`label_*.txt`) contain corresponding entity labels per token

**Tagging Scheme:** BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside)

Example:

```
Sentence:  I want cheap sushi in Tokyo
Labels:    O O B-PRICE B-FOOD O B-LOCATION
```

The sentence and label files are aligned line-by-line to ensure correct token-level supervision during training.
